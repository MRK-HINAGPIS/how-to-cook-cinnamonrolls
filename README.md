# How to cook Cinnamon Rolls
## This website will guide you how to make Cinnamon rolls.
## Description
Because they only take one rise, these simple cinnamon rolls are ideal for yeast beginners. Top with vanilla frosting or my favorite coffee icing, which I've included below.

## Ingredients
### - Rolls
2 and 3/4 cups (344g) all-purpose flour (spoon & leveled)
1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 and 1/4 teaspoons Red Star Platinum Yeast or any instant yeast (1 packet)
1/2 cup (120ml) whole milk
1/4 cup (60ml) water
3 Tablespoons unsalted butter
1 large egg
### - Filling
3 Tablespoons (45g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
1 Tablespoon ground cinnamon
1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar or packed light or dark brown sugar
### - Icing
1 cup (120g) confectioners’ sugar
1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
2–3 Tablespoons (30-45ml) strong brewed coffee or milk
## Instructions
- To make the dough, combine the flour, sugar, salt, and yeast in a large mixing basin. Place aside.
In a heatproof bowl, combine the milk, water, and butter. Heat in the microwave or on the stove until the butter is melted and the mixture is warm to the touch (approximately 110°F). Pour into the dry ingredients, add the egg, and whisk or use a mixer to produce a soft dough.

- Knead the dough for 3 minutes on a lightly floured surface using floured hands. Place in a lightly greased (I use nonstick spray) bowl, cover loosely, and set aside for 10 minutes.

- Fill the rolls: After 10 minutes, roll out the dough into a 14-inch rectangle. Top with the softened butter. Combine the cinnamon and sugar. Spread it evenly over the dough. Roll the dough tightly into a 14-inch log. Cut the rolls into 10-12 even pieces and place them in a lightly greased 9-inch round cake pan or pie dish.

- Allow the rolls to rise in a warm, draft-free location for 60-90 minutes, tightly wrapped in aluminum foil or plastic wrap.
Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C) after the rolls have doubled in size. Bake for 25-28 minutes, or until the top is lightly browned. If the tops of the rolls begin to brown too rapidly, loosely cover them with aluminum foil and continue baking.

- To make the icing, combine the confectioners' sugar, vanilla extract, and coffee/milk. Drizzle or spread on hot buns.

- Cover leftover frosted or unfrosted rolls tightly and keep at room temperature for up to 3 days or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
## Notes

- Make Ahead Directions: You may make this dough the night before by following step 4. Wrap with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator overnight. Remove from the refrigerator the next morning and leave to rise for 1 hour in a warm environment. Step 6 will be followed.

- Instructions for freezing baked rolls: Baked rolls can be frozen for up to 2-3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight and warm up before serving. You can also freeze the unbaked rolls by baking them for about 10 minutes at 375°F (191°C) in step 6. Allow to cool fully before firmly wrapping and freezing. To serve, remove the rolls from the freezer and place in the refrigerator for a few hours before serving. Then bake them till done.

- Yeast: I strongly advise using instant yeast. You can substitute active dry yeast if you only have active dry yeast. In recipes, both active dry yeast and quick yeast can be used interchangeably (1:1). Active dry yeast rises at a moderate rate, while instant dry yeast rises at a higher rate; active dry yeast will produce a slower rise time.

- Whole milk is best for this dough. Nondairy milk can be used if necessary.
